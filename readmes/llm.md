# LLM (Large Language Model)

## Client
### openai_client
This creates an OpenAI client object as described in this v1.0.0 beta [documentation](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/631). You can use this object to call the OpenAI API.
Azure OpenAI is not currently supported by this function, but it is if you use the OpenAI package directly (via the AzureOpenAI client object).
